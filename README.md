"Scorpius" is an experimental video piece that merges provocative visual content with cutting-edge web technology. Created during Scorpio season, this work is a montage of gay erotica, glitched images, and other media, aiming to evoke the subliminal aspects of Scorpio's legendary intensity. Through glitch art techniques and digital manipulation, the piece explores themes of sexuality, astrological symbolism, passion, and subliminality.

The artwork is presented via a custom-built interactive 3D web application, developed using Three.js and WebGL. This bespoke video player creates an immersive environment, applying lens distortion effects through custom shaders that complement the glitch aesthetic of the content. The application's interactive elements invite viewers to engage directly with the piece, potentially deepening their perception of the "scorpionic intensities" at play.

By fusing provocative artistic content with advanced web graphics capabilities, "Scorpius" offers a unique digital art experience that challenges viewers to explore the intersection of technology, sexuality, and astrological symbolism.
